# Transformations
I designed and implemented a Java project focused on Graphical User Interface programming, creating an interactive math-learning application for learning Quadratic transformations. The application enables users to manipulate key parameters of a base quadratic graph and subsequently assesses their comprehension through targeted test questions.

When the application is launched, users encounter two quadratic graphs shown on the Cartesian plane. One of these graphs remains consistent (grey) and acts as a reference for comparison against the transformed graph, while the other (red) can be transformed using sliders located on the left side of the interface.

As the user interacts with the four sliders, we notice transformations take place within the red graph. The values set on the sliders are integrated into the general quadratic transformation notation, which is displayed at the lower-left corner of the interface.

Should the user require more assistance using the application, the "Need Help?" button allows the user to be familiar with the functionality of the application.

For users seeking clarification on which aspect of the base quadratic graph each variable/slider modifies, the "Transformations" button reveals a comprehensive breakdown of the role played by each variable.

When the user feels confident with their knowledge of the concepts, they may go ahead and test their knowledge of quadratic transformations by clicking on the "Check Understanding" button on the intro page.

Once the questions have been answered, they are able to verify the correctness of their answers by clicking on the "Solutions of Understanding Questions" location in the bottom part of the user interface.

To use the application, simply download the QuadTransform.jar file from the repository and exectue it on your computer. Please make sure that you have the latest JDK Development in order to be able to execute it, which you can download from the link https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java8-windows for Windows and https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk20-mac for MacOS.
