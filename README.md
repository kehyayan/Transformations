# Transformations
I designed and implemented a Java project focused on Graphical User Interface programming, creating an interactive math-learning application for learning Quadratic transformations. The application enables users to manipulate key parameters of a base quadratic graph and subsequently assesses their comprehension through targeted test questions.

Upon opening the application, the user is introduced with two base qudratic graphs on the cartesian plane - one of them is fixed (grey graph), and the other is variable (red graph) through the sliders on the left side of the interface.
