# Transformations
I designed and implemented a Java project focused on Graphical User Interface programming, creating an interactive math-learning application for learning Quadratic transformations. The application enables users to manipulate key parameters of a base quadratic graph and subsequently assesses their comprehension through targeted test questions.

When the application is launched, users encounter two quadratic graphs shown on the Cartesian plane. One of these graphs remains consistent (grey) and acts as a reference for comparison against the transformed graph, while the other (red) can be transformed using sliders located on the left side of the interface.

As the user interacts with the four sliders, we notice transformations take place within the red graph. The values set on the sliders are integrated into the general quadratic transformation notation, which is displayed at the lower-left corner of the interface.
